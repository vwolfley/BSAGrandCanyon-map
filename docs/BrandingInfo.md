## Boy Scouting ##
### Brand Platform ###
Boy Scouts. Be Prepared-for anything.

Most boys avoid obstacles. Boy Scouts seek them. They live for any opportunity to
display their abilities while learning new skills. Camping is fun. Surviving a downpour in
the middle of the night is an adventure. Cooking over a campfire is fun. Learning which
wild berries are edible is survival. Spending a weekend in the woods is fun. Breaking
camp without leaving a trace is admirable. These are invaluable experiences that can
be had in Scouting. These are life lessons that transform today’s Boy Scouts into
tomorrow’s leaders.

### Boy Scouting Value ###
Through Boy Scouting, you can go places, test yourself, and have one-of-a-kind
adventures you can’t get anywhere else.

## Cub Scouting ##
### Brand Platform ###
Cub Scouts. Do Your Best.  Have Fun Doing It.

The best way to find out what you do best is to do it. Swing a bat. Pitch a tent. Build
a pinewood derby® car. Cub Scouts are at that magical age where everything is new
and possible and, most important, fun. They live in a world of “firsts”—first home run,
first campfire, first checkered flag—where their game plan is their imagination.
Their most valuable reward is the friends they make for life and a parent’s proud smile.
These are invaluable experiences that can be had in Scouting. These are life lessons
that transform today’s Cub Scouts into tomorrow’s Boy Scouts.

### Cub Scouting Value ###
Through Cub Scouting, you and your friends can see and learn fun, new things you can’t
get anywhere else.

## Venturing ##
### Brand Platform ###
Venturing. Challenge Yourself. Challenge Your World.

Life is a series of tests. Shooting the rapids. Rappelling a cliff. Writing a resume.
Each one can be a setback, or a chance to shine. Working as a team, the young
adults in every Venturing crew welcome the opportunity to pass these trials. A series
of successes that build one upon another. Every person playing their role. No one
more important than their partners. No challenge achievable without cooperation.
These are invaluable experiences that can be had in Scouting. These are life lessons
that transform today’s Venturers into tomorrow’s responsible adults.

### Venturing Value ###
Through Venturing, you and your friends can see the world and experience the adventure
of Scouting.
